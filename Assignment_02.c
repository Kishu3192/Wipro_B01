// pseudocode to calculate even and odd 

step 1 Start

step 2 declare a variable n

step 3 take input from user

step 4 if(n%2 == 0) then 
        square = n * n
        print square of n is,square
        
       else
        cube = n * n * n
        print cube of n is, cube

 // algorithem for login system

 step 1 start

 step 2 take input as userid and password

 step 3 if(correct){
            print userid is valid
        else
            print userid is invalid  
 }
      go to step 2  

 step 4     if(correct){

// for factorial of number 

step 1 start

step 2 read number

step 3 set fact = 1, i = 1

step 4 if(i<number)
           go to step 5
        else
           go to step 7

step 5 fact = fact * i

step 6 increment i = i + 1 
       go to step 4

step 7 print fact

step 8 stop


// Explanation of factorial of number

step 1 start the operation 

step 2 first we take the number from user how many factorial number they want

step 3 we set fact = 1 bz we are multiply with that if we multiply with 1 we get a same number

step 4 check the iteration number is less than equal to input number if true follow step 5 else come out of the loop

step 5 fact multiply with each iteration

step 6 increment the iteration by 1

step 7 display factorial result on screen 

step 8 End the operation


// algorithem for fibonacci number

step 1 start

step 2 intialize a=0,b=1,res,i,n

step 3 read input 

step 4 for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
       else go to step 7

step 5 print a

step 6 res = a + b
       a = b
       b = res

step 7  End


// explnation of fibonacci number

step 1 start the operation

step 2 intialize value of a and b bz we start from this two res for storing the value 
       i for iteration and n for input

step 3 take the input from user how many fibonacci they want

step 4 use for loop for each iteration check the condition and increment operation

step 5 display value on screen 

step 6 adding last two value and store in res
       assign b value to a
       assign res value to b

step 7 end the operation   


// Modularity in programming

  In modularity we can break down program into a specific task to perform their indiviual   operation  
  
  code resuablity : we can reuse code whenever we want at a specific location 
  for example : if we defined a function once then we can call where we want because of that    code can avoid rewriting of code.
  
  Ease of maintenance : if you wanted to make changes or fix the bug without affecting other module 
  
  Encapsulation : hiding the implementation details from the rest of program that will reduce the dependencies different part of program that will make program more robust
